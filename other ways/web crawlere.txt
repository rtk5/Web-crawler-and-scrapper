Purpose
Web crawlers help search engines build an index of web pages so that they can return more accurate and faster search results. 
 
How it works
Web crawlers access websites, gather information about each page, and index the content. This information includes titles, images, keywords, and links. 
 
Types
There are internet web crawlers that crawl the entire internet, and enterprise web crawlers that crawl a specific business website. 
 
Tools
Web crawler tools are available as desktop or cloud tools. Desktop tools are installed and stored on a computer, while cloud tools use cloud computing. 
 
Challenges
Web crawlers can consume resources on visited systems and often visit sites without being prompted. High-frequency crawling can strain servers, leading to slow loading times or even server downtimes. 
 
Benefits
Web crawlers can help SaaS companies align their content with user needs, which can improve user engagement, SEO rankings, and user satisfaction
